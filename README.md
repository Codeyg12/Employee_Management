## Todo
- Actual README
- set up database for live page, both in employee_manag - settings.py and mydb
- Make entire row clickable on employeee table (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59040984/make-rows-in-django-table-clickable#:~:text=You%20might%20use%20%3Cspan%20class,to%20the%20tag.)
- size issue on mobile
- unique ids (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16925129/generate-unique-id-in-django-from-a-model-field)
- confirmation of deleting all (are you sure you want to delete?) (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37398416/django-delete-confirmation)
- view employees by department, maybe when viewing department can cclick on department name and will display all employees
- link to add from the view table
- Proper punctuation on all messages.error|success
- logout after set time
- changing sorting of employees
- forms, select from models muted text issue
- DRY OUT THIS CODE
- When selecting role for new employee it auto adds department
- Change error page for user attemps I.E. user types in '/budget/112'
- Either change budgets to be on view_departments or figure out how to add in views
- On budget maybe break down each employee??
- (not registered?) 
- scroll groups for too many enteries on table (i.e. the employee table, which is long)
