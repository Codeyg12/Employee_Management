## Todo
-https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27562  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16925129/generate-unique-id-in-django-from-a-model-field
- Actual README
- set up database for live page, both in employee_manag - settings.py and mydb
- DRY OUT THIS CODE
- view employees by department, maybe when viewing department can cclick on department name and will display all employees
- When selecting role for new employee it auto adds department
- Change error page for user attemps I.E. user types in '/budget/112', custom 404 page
- From departments add a 'View Employees' btn for all employees in department
- font awesome icons, do I keep the 'fa-sm' or do I want to make it large?
- Remove the `<a class="link-secondary text-decoration-none link-opacity-50-hover" href="{% url 'department' department.id %}">{{department.department_name}}</a>` from the clickable tables, are we comfortable with the style changes? Regardless its redundant to double up on the links
- check for all unused vars
