## Todo
- Actual README
- set up database for live page, both in employee_manag - settings.py and mydb
- size issue on mobile
- view employees by department, maybe when viewing department can cclick on department name and will display all employees
- forms, select from models muted text issue
- DRY OUT THIS CODE
- When selecting role for new employee it auto adds department
- Change error page for user attemps I.E. user types in '/budget/112'
- Either change budgets to be on view_departments or figure out how to add in views
- On budget maybe break down each employee??
- (not registered?) 
- scroll groups for too many enteries on table (i.e. the employee table, which is long)
