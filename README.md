## Todo
-https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27562  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16925129/generate-unique-id-in-django-from-a-model-field
- Actual README
- set up database for live page, both in employee_manag - settings.py and mydb
- size issue on mobile
- DRY OUT THIS CODE
- view employees by department, maybe when viewing department can cclick on department name and will display all employees
- When selecting role for new employee it auto adds department
- Change error page for user attemps I.E. user types in '/budget/112'
- Either change budgets to be on view_departments or figure out how to add in views
- On budget maybe break down each employee??
